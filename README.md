# Hi, I'm Khoi Nguyen  

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a Computer Science & Mathematics student at the **University of Toronto** with a strong interest in **backend development**, **distributed computing**, **computer languages**, and **operating systems**.  

I enjoy solving challenging engineering problems, tinkering with new technologies, and building systems that scale.  

## Tools & Technologies  

- **Languages:** Golang, Ruby, C/C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, Shell/Bash  
- **Backend & Frameworks:** Go-Chi, FastAPI, Node.js/Express, Flask, React  
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite  
- **Cloud & Systems:** AWS (S3, IoT Core, EC2, RDS), Docker, Kafka, CUDA  
- **Developer Tools:** Git, Jenkins, Perforce, GDB, Valgrind

## Interests  

- **Backend Development** — designing reliable, maintainable, and scalable systems.  
- **Distributed Computing** — building event-driven and cloud-native systems.  
- **Computer Languages** — exploring how language design impacts performance and usability.  
- **Operating Systems** — learning the internals that power modern computing.
